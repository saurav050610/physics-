# Density 
- Density is the mass in unit volume of a substance.
- Equal masses of two substance may have different volume.
- Equal volumes of two substance may have different mass.
## Unit of density 
- The SI unit of density is Kilogram per cubic metre, which is written  as kg/m^3 or kg m^-3.
- The CGS unit of density is, the smaller unit gram per cubic centimetre, which is written as g/cm^3 or g cm^-3 or g/cc.
- Formulae of density is density=maas/volume.
## Determining the Density of Regular Solid 
- The mass of the regular solid is determined by using beam balance or any other suitable type of balance.
- The volume of regular solid is calculated using one of the following formulae.
1. volume of cube =(side)^3
2. volume of cuboid =length* bredth *height 
3. volume of sphere =4/3 pie(radius)^3
4. volume of cylinder =pie* (radius)^2 *height (where pie = 3.14 approximated as 22/7)
