# Density 
- Density is the mass in unit volume of a substance.
- Equal masses of two substance may have different volume.
- Equal volumes of two substance may have different mass.
## Unit of density 
- The SI unit of density is Kilogram per cubic metre, which is written  as kg/m^3 or kg m^-3.
- The CGS unit of density is, the smaller unit gram per cubic centimetre, which is written as g/cm^3 or g cm^-3 or g/cc.
- Formulae of density is density=maas/volume.
## Determining the Density of Regular Solids 
- The mass of the regular solid is determined by using beam balance or any other suitable type of balance.
- The volume of regular solid is calculated using one of the following formulae.
1. volume of cube =(side)^3
2. volume of cuboid =length* bredth *height 
3. volume of sphere =4/3 pie(radius)^3
4. volume of cylinder =pie* (radius)^2 *height (where pie = 3.14 approximated as 22/7)
## Determining the Density of Irregular Solids
- The mass of the Irregular solid is calculated by displacement method.
- The volume of Irregular solid is calculated by apparatuses.
- The volume of liquid can be found uising the following apparatuses:- 
1. Measuring jar or cup:- The measuring jar or cup is a container of a fixed capacity. It is made of plastic, glass or metal, and its capacity is marked on it. Common capacities of measuring jars are 50ml,100ml,200ml,500ml,1000ml(1l).
2. Measuring cylinder:- A measuring cylinder or graduated cylinder is a container of a fixed capacity that has volumes marked vertically on its side (commoinly in millilitres). There are measuring cylinders of different capacities, such as 10ml,50ml,100ml,200ml,500ml,and 1000ml. The capacity of a measurig cylinder is marked on it.
3. Eureka can:- A eureka can is a container made of glass, plastic or metal. It looks like a beaker with a spout near the top. This water can be collected in graduted cylinder and its volume measured. 
## Determining the Density of Liquids 
- The mass of the liquid is determined. This is done by calculatig the mas of empty conatiner such as beaker, and then calculating the mass of the same container after the liquid has been poured in it. The difference in the mass give the mass of the liquid.
- Next, the volume of the liquid is found.
- Finally, the density of the liquid is calculated using the standard formulae density=mass/volume.
## Density bottle
- A density bottle is used to calculate the density of liquids. It is a small, thin walled glass bottle. It has a stopper with a small hole. When the bottle is filled with a liquid and a stopper inserted, excees liquid rise up in the hole and drains away. Thus, the density bottle always contains the same volume of liquid each time it is filled. Density bottles are usually of capacity 25ml or 50ml.
# Relative density 
- Relative density is a measure of hown dense a substance is in relation to a standard substance.
- The usual standard used for solids and liquids is water at 4^.c.
- The relative density of a substance is the ration of density of substance to density of water at 4^.c.
- Relative density is also known as specific gravity. 
# Formulae of Relative density 
- M1= density of empty bottle.
- M2= density of bottle filled with any liquid.
- M3= density of water/ IF any other liquid is given there. 
## Density of Matter in the Three States
- In solids, the particles are packed closely together. This results in more mass being packed within a small volume. 
- In liquids, The particles are as closely packed as in solids. Thus, less mass is packed in small volume. A substance usually has lower density in the liquid state than in the solid state. Most liquids have lower density than solids.
- In gass, the particles are very loosely in the same volume. Gases thus have a much lower density than solids and liquids.
- Not all liquids are denser than solids ex:- cork (with a density of about 0.25g/cm^3) is a solid but is less dense than water (with a density of 1g/cm^3)
## Hydrometer 
- A hydrometer is an instrument that is used to measure the density of liquids. 
- It consist of long glass tube with a broad bulb at the bottom that contains a heavy liquid. 
- A scale with relative densities is marked on the stem. To measure the density of given liquid, the hydrometer is allowed to float in the liquid. The level at which it flats in the liquid is a measure of the density of the liquid. 
## Flotation and Sinking
- All substance that have a relative density of less than 1, such as wood, cork and ice float on water. These substance have a lower density than water, and thus have less mass packed in a given volume than water does.
- All substance that have a relative density of more that 1 such as lead, copper and iron, sink in water, These substance have a higher density than water, and thus have more mass packed in a given volume that water does.
