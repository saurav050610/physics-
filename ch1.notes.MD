# Chracteristics of matter 
- Matter has mass and occupies space.
- Matter is made of unique substance called elements.
- An atom is the smallest unit of an element that has the charcateristics of that element.
- Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule.
- A molecule is the smallest unit of matter capable of independent exsistence. 
- A molecule consist of one or more atoms of the same element or of different element.
- Molecules of the same substance are identical.
- Molecules are extremeley tiny. They can't be seen with naked eyes; they can only be seen with an electron microscope.
## Kinetic theory of matter 
- The kinetic theory of matter helps to explain the behaviour of matter.
- Matter is made of tiny particles called molecules 
- In molecules there are spaces these spaces are called intermolecular space.
- Molecules are attracted to each other because intermolecular force of attraction.
- Molecules move continuosly. Hence, they posses kinetic energy.
- When the temperature of matter is increased the kinetice energy also increase and when the temperature decreases the kinetic energy also decreases hence the kinetic energy of molecules is directly proportional.
### Properties of Solids
- Solid have a definite shaoe and size.
- Solid have a definite volume.
- In solid intermolecular space is neligible the molecules are closely packed.
- Solids are almost incomprissible.
- Solids cannot flow.
- Solids are not rigid.
- Solids have any number of free surface.
- Solid have least energy and cannot move freely.
- Solids expand slightly on heating.
### Properties of Liquids 
- Liquid does not have definite shape and size.
- Liquid does not have definite volume.
- Liquid have very small-molecules are less closely packed.
- In liquid the intermolecular force of attraction is not strong as the solid.
- Liquid are almost incomprissible.
- Liquid can flow.
- Liquid less rigid.
- Liquid have only 1 free surface.
- Liquid have have more energy than solid and move freely in the container.
- Liquid expand more than solids on heating.
### Properties of Gases
- Gas do not have a definite shape and size.
- Gas do not have definite volume.
- In gas the intermolecular space is very large-molecules are very loosely packed.
- In gas the intermolecular force of attraction is very weak.
- Gas are highly compressible.
- Gas can flow.
- Gas are not rigid.
- Gas have no free surface.
- Gas have most energy and move freely at high speeds.
- Gas expand to fill all available space on heating.
