# Chracteristics of matter 
- Matter has mass and occupies space.
- Matter is made of unique substance called elements.
- An atom is the smallest unit of an element that has the charcateristics of that element.
- Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule.
- A molecule is the smallest unit of matter capable of independent exsistence. 
- A molecule consist of one or more atoms of the same element or of different element.
- Molecules of the same substance are identical.
- Molecules are extremeley tiny. They can't be seen with naked eyes; they can only be seen with an electron microscope.
## Kinetic theory of matter 
- The kinetic theory of matter helps to explain the behaviour of matter.
- Matter is made of tiny particles called molecules 
- In molecules there are spaces these spaces are called intermolecular space.
- Molecules are attracted to each other because intermolecular force of attraction.
- Molecules move continuosly. Hence, they posses kinetic energy.
- When the temperature of matter is increased the kinetice energy also increase and when the temperature decreases the kinetic energy also decreases hence the kinetic energy of molecules is directly proportional.
### Properties of Solids
- Solid have a definite shaoe and size.
- Solid have a definite volume.
- In solid intermolecular space is neligible the molecules are closely packed.
- Solids are almost incomprissible.
- Solids cannot flow.
- Solids are not rigid.
- Solids have any number of free surface.
- Solid have least energy and cannot move freely.
- Solids expand slightly on heating.
### Properties of Liquids 
- Liquid does not have definite shape and size.
- Liquid does not have definite volume.
- Liquid have very small-molecules are less closely packed.
- In liquid the intermolecular force of attraction is not strong as the solid.
- Liquid are almost incomprissible.
- Liquid can flow.
- Liquid less rigid.
- Liquid have only 1 free surface.
- Liquid have have more energy than solid and move freely in the container.
- Liquid expand more than solids on heating.
### Properties of Gases
- Gas do not have a definite shape and size.
- Gas do not have definite volume.
- In gas the intermolecular space is very large-molecules are very loosely packed.
- In gas the intermolecular force of attraction is very weak.
- Gas are highly compressible.
- Gas can flow.
- Gas are not rigid.
- Gas have no free surface.
- Gas have most energy and move freely at high speeds.
- Gas expand to fill all available space on heating.
## Cohesion and Adhesion
- The force of attraction between molecules of the same kind is known as cohesion. 
- It kepps the molecules of a substance together.
- The force of attraction between molecules of different substance is known as adhesion. 
## Brownian motion 
- In a liquids and gas the molecules move constantly in random direction. This motion is called brownian motion.
## Change of state 
* Change of state involves the  absorption or evolution of heat. The process of change one state to anothe occurs at different temperatures 
for different substance. During the process, the temperature remains constant till the changeof state is complete. A change of state causes a change in physical properties but not in chemical properties.
### Melting or Fusion
* In solids, the molecules are closely packed and are held together by 
strong forces. However, they vibrate constantly. When a solid is heated,
the molecules vibrate faster. Starting from the outer surface, the molecules overcome the intermolecular force between them and move away from one another. The intermolecular space increases. The solid then becomes a liquid, starting from its outer surface. The temperature remains constant till all the molecules have absorbed enough energy to
enter the liquid state.
* The process by which a solid melts to form a liquid when heated is called melting or fusion this occurs at a fixed temperature at which a substance changes from solid state to its liquid state on heating is called the melting point of substance. 
### Vaporisation 
* The change of state of a substance from liquid to vapour state is called vaporisation. Both boiling and evaporation are forms of vaporisation.
* Boiling :- When a liquid is heated, the molecuels acquire enegy and move around at random in liquid with greater energy. At certain temperature, all the molecule acquire enough energy to overcome th intermolecular force of attraction. At this temperature, the liquid is converted to vapour from everywhere within the body of the liquid. This is called  boiling. The fixed temperature at which a pure substance boils and chages its liquid state to its gaseous state on heating is called boiling point of the liqud.

* Evaporation :- Molecules inside the liquid are attracted by molecules on all sides.But liquid has a free surface. At the surface liquid is attracted by other liquid molecues have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction of liquid molecules, they escape from surface. These escaping molecules from the vapour of the liquid. Hence, even before the boiling point is reached, many molecules of liquids leaves its surface that is they vaporise. The gradual change of state of a substance from liquid to vapour that happens at all temperatures
is called evaporation. It is a surface phenomenon. It takes place at the surface of the liquid and not throughout the liquid. The heat required for evaporation is absorbed from the liquid and anything in contact with it. This has a cooling effect on the objects in contact with the liquid. 

### Condensation 
- Condensation is the process in which the vapour is converted into liquid,
- The fixed temperature at which the state of a pure substance changes from gas to liquid on cooling is called condensation point.

### Freezing 
- Freezing is the process in which liquid changes to solid.
- The fixed temperature at which the state of a pure substance changed from liquid to solid on cooling is called the freezing point.

### Sublimation 
- Sublimation ios the process in which solid changes to directly to vapour is called sublimation.
- Example of solid which sublimates are camphor, napthalene, ammonium chloride and iodine.

### Deposition 
- Deposition is the process in which vaour directly changes to solid.
