# Chracteristics of matter 
- Matter has mass and occupies space.
- Matter is made of unique substance called elements.
- An atom is the smallest unit of an element that has the charcateristics of that element.
- Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule.
- A molecule is the smallest unit of matter capable of independent exsistence. 
- A molecule consist of one or more atoms of the same element or of different element.
- Molecules of the same substance are identical.
- Molecules are extremeley tiny. They can't be seen with naked eyes; they can only be seen with an electron microscope.
## Kinetic theory of matter 
- The kinetic theory of matter helps to explain the behaviour of matter.
- Matter is made of tiny particles called molecules 
- In molecules there are spaces these spaces are called intermolecular space.
- Molecules are attracted to each other because intermolecular force of attraction.
- Molecules move continuosly. Hence, they posses kinetic energy.
- When the temperature of matter is increased the kinetice energy also increase and when the temperature decreases the kinetic energy also decreases hence the kinetic energy of molecules is directly proportional.
